# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to add something here. Seriously—typos, new slides, weird SRE/cybersecurity stuff, whatever. If it helps, it’s fair game.

## Quick version

1. Fork it (unless you can push directly).
2. Make a new branch for your changes.
3. Write in Markdown. If you’re doing slides: `.md` files with Marp frontmatter.
   - Preview with [Marp CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli) or the VSCode Marp extension.
4. Don’t overthink it. Add value, keep it readable, move fast.
5. Open a pull request. One sentence about what you did is enough.

## Style

- Plain English is king. If you must use jargon, make it useful or at least funny.
- Short, punchy slides > giant walls of text.
- Code should work if someone copy-pastes it. No “it works on my laptop.”
- If you can tie in DevOps/SRE/cybersec, go for it.
- Docs-as-code > docs-in-email.

## FAQ

Q: Can I automate slide generation?
A: Please do. Bots, scripts, whatever. Just don’t make things messier.

Q: Is there a linter?
A: Nope. If you want one, PR it in.

Q: Who reviews PRs?
A: Could be me, could be a bot, could be nobody. If you’re reading this, maybe you.

## Tips

- Add yourself to `contributors.md` if you want. No ego, just history.
- If you’re stuck in Windows land, no shame—Markdown works everywhere.
- If you break something, fix it or open an issue. No blame.
