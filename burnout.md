## Introduction to overcommitment

*   **What is overcommitment?**
    *   Taking on more responsibilities than can reasonably be handled.
    *   Feeling obligated to say "yes" to every request.
    *   Difficulty prioritizing tasks and setting boundaries.
*   **Why do we do it?**
    *   Desire to prove competence or be a "team player".
    *   Fear of disappointing others or appearing unhelpful.
    *   Lack of clarity about job expectations or available resources.

## The manager's perspective: asking for more

*   **The Best Intentions:** Managers often assign tasks or seek assistance believing in their team's capabilities.
*   **Potential blind spots:**
    *   Underestimating existing workloads or project complexity.
    *   Focusing solely on task completion without considering the individual's capacity.
    *   Unaware of the cumulative effect of small requests.
*   **A "Yes" can mask a "No":** Silence or unnatural agreeability may indicate potential burnout.

---

## The employee's perspective: feeling the strain

*   **A Growing Burden:** A once manageable workload morphs into a crushing weight.
*   **The struggle to say "no":** Fear of negative repercussions, being perceived as weak or uncommitted.
*   **Productivity drops:** The "zoning out" effect.
    *   Mental and emotional exhaustion makes focus and concentration nearly impossible.
    *   Tasks take longer, quality may suffer, and deadlines are missed.
    *   Apathy and detachment set in, making work feel meaningless.

---

## Why productivity may appear to be zero

*   **Cognitive dysfunction:** Burnout impairs the brain's ability to focus, concentrate, and process information.
*   **Decision fatigue:** Even minor decisions become overwhelming, leading to delays and inaction.
*   **Loss of motivation & enthusiasm:** The joy and purpose once found in work evaporate, leaving a sense of emptiness.
*   **The Cycle of Overwhelm:** Tasks pile up, increasing stress, further hindering performance.

## Recognizing the signs of impending burnout (for both parties)

*   **Emotional exhaustion:** Feeling drained and unable to cope.
*   **Cynicism & detachment:** A negative, indifferent, or resentful attitude towards work.
*   **Reduced effectiveness:** Feeling inadequate or like efforts don't matter.
*   **Physical symptoms:** Persistent fatigue, headaches, difficulty sleeping, increased illness.
*   **Behavioral changes:** Withdrawal, irritability, mood swings, increased absenteeism.

## What can we do?

*   **For managers:**
    *   **Open communication:** Regularly check-in with employees, asking about workload and challenges.
    *   **Fair workload distribution:** Monitor and adjust workloads to ensure reasonable expectations.
    *   **Encourage boundaries:** Promote work-life balance and respect personal time.
    *   **Offer support:** Provide resources and foster a culture where asking for help is encouraged.
*   **For employees:**
    *   **Practice self-awareness:** Recognize the signs of burnout early.
    *   **Set boundaries:** Learn to say "no" and protect personal time.
    *   **Prioritize & delegate:** Effectively manage tasks and seek assistance when needed.
    *   **Seek support:** Talk to supervisors, colleagues, or professionals when feeling overwhelmed.

## Towards a healthier work environment

*   **Shared Responsibility:** Creating a healthy workplace is a collaborative effort.
*   **Prioritize well-being:** Fostering a culture that values physical and mental health.
*   **Invest in solutions:** Implement policies and programs that support employees and prevent burnout.
