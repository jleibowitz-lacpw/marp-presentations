# Permacomputing: Designing for a Sustainable Digital Future

## Bridging Permacomputing with Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language

---

# The Problem: Unsustainable Computing

*   **Environmental Impact:** High energy consumption, resource depletion, e-waste.
*   **Social & Economic Impact:** Digital divide, planned obsolescence, platform lock-in.
*   **Technological Debt:** Complex, fragile systems that are hard to maintain.

---

# Permacomputing: A New Philosophy

*   **Inspired by Permaculture:** Designing for longevity, resilience, and sustainability in computing.
*   **Emphasis on:**
    *   **Longevity:** Design for durability and long lifespans.
    *   **Resilience:** Systems that can adapt to changing conditions and failures.
    *   **Efficiency:** Minimize energy and resource consumption.
    *   **Human-centric:** Technology that empowers individuals and communities.
